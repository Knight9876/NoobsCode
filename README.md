# Welcome to NoobsCode!
NoobsCode is an innovative gaming website designed to make learning how to code an enjoyable and interactive experience. With its user-friendly interface and engaging gameplay, users can enhance their coding skills while having fun.

# Modes:
1. Blind Code:
In Blind Code mode, the screen is divided into two sections. On the right side, a code snippet will be displayed in the user's chosen programming language (Python, C, Java, or JavaScript). On the left side, a pitch-black screen awaits, where users must write the code blindly based on the snippet provided. Upon submission, a compiler will display any errors encountered during compilation.

2. Scramble Code:
In Scramble Code mode, users are presented with a jumbled code snippet. Their task is to rearrange the code snippets in the correct sequence to execute the code without errors. After submission, a compiler will highlight any errors detected in the arranged code.

# Languages:
CodeQuest supports four programming languages:
1. Python
2. C
3. Java
4. JavaScript

# Features:
1. Timer: Both Blind Code and Scramble Code modes come with a timer, challenging users to complete the tasks within the allotted time. Users can adjust the timer settings to suit their preferences.
2. Error Detection: A compiler checks the submitted code for errors and provides feedback to help users identify and correct mistakes.
3. Customization: Users can customize their learning experience by choosing their preferred programming language and adjusting the timer settings.
